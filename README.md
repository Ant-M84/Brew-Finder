# Brew Finder

https://ant-m84.github.io/Brew-Finder/

## Description

This application is designed for a user to search their current location or a specified location of their choice to locate nearby bars or breweries where they can get an alcoholic brew!

Brew Finder negates the need to utilize a map or search engine application and will list nearby establishments by name, address, contact number and website - if applicable.

## Installation

Brew Finder is web-based and simply requires navigation to the application URL. Saved searches are stored in local storage and can be cleared by the user if required.

## Usage

To search for the nearest establisments to your location, click 'Search my location' for a list of places nearby.

If you wish to search in a specific location, enter the city/town in the input section, then click 'Search'.

The results of the search for either option will appear on the right side of the browser for larger resolution devices, or underneath if utilizing a mobile device.
